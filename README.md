# University-Admit-Eligibility-Predictor
## Overview
Student admission problem is very important in educational institutions. This paper addresses machine learning models to predict the chance of a student to be admitted to a
master’s program. This will assist students to know in advance if they have a chance to get accepted. Newly graduate students usually are not knowledgeable of the requirements 
and the procedures of the postgraduate admission and might spent a considerable amount of money to get advice from consultancy organizations to help them identify their 
admission chances. Human consultant and calculations might be bias and inaccurate. The machine learning models are multiple linear regression, k-nearest neighbor, random 
forest, and multi-layer Perceptron. Experiments show that the Multi-layer Perceptron model surpasses other models.
## Purpose
It helps student for making decision for choosing a right college. Here the chance of occurrence of error is less when compared with the existing system. It is fast, 
efficient and reliable. Avoids data redundancy and inconsistency. Very user-friendly. Easy accessibility of data. It helps you to understand as to how your profile can be 
further improved to secure an admit in your target college. It can guide you whether you need to retake the GRE or not, in order to improve your chances of landing an admit 
in your preferred university. Students from rural background find it difficult to do the necessary analysis and prepare a preference list. This idea will be beneficial for
them. Students who belong to multiple categories face difficulty in analyzing cut-offs in each of these categories and predict the best colleges they can get an admission 
in. Whatsoever is the student’s rank, this application will aid them in finding the best branch and college for his/her rank. This accommodates the need of students to 
choose the best college and helps colleges too to recognize their stand in attracting students and finer prediction implies better results for the students.
## Conclusion
Student admission problem is very important in educational institutions. In this project addresses machine learning models to predict the chance of a student to be admitted.
This will assist students to know in advance if they have a chance to get accepted. In this paper, machine learning models were performed to predict the opportunity of a
student to get admitted to a master’s program. The machine learning models included are multiple linear regression, k nearest neighbor, random forest, and Multi-layer
Perceptron. Experiments show that the Multi-layer Perceptron model surpasses other models. As for the future work, more models can be conducted on more datasets to learn the
model that gives the best performance.
